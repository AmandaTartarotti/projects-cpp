# projects cpp
The programs presented in this repository are simple projects and tests written in C++. 
Some of these programs are utilities and scripts that can be used on a day-to-day basis to perform certain functions.
The programs contained here were developed thinking about the Linux platform.

```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/range
g++ range.cpp -o range
./range
```

## divisors
### Description:
That program reads an integer n and prints all numbers d between 1 and n−1 such that d is a divisor of n (e.g. 1, 2, and 5 if n is 10).
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/divisors
g++ divisors.cpp -o divisors
./divisors
```

## fizz-buzz
### Description:
This is a C++ program that “plays” a version of the known game FizzBuzz over a sequence of natural numbers up to an integer n provided by the user.

The program should build and finally print a string with each number in the sequence separated by a space. However:

If the number is a multiple of 3, appends the word "Fizz" instead
If the number is a multiple of 5, appends the word "Buzz" instead
If the number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, nothing is done
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/fizz-buzz
g++ fizz-buzz.cpp -o fizz-buzz
./fizz-buzz
```

## char-types
### Description:
That C++ program reads an integer number n by user input followed by n characters, all separated by spaces, and then prints the number of characters read that are letters, the number of characters read that are digits, and the number of characters read that are not letters or digits.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/char-types
g++ char-types.cpp -o char-types
./char-types
```

## pi
### Description:
The value of Π can be approximated by the Gregory–Leibniz series.

This is a C++ program that given integers k and d prints the k-th approximation with d decimal places.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/pi
g++ pi.cpp -o pi
./pi
```

## primes
### Description:
This program takes an integer n, provided by the user, and prints all prime numbers up to n.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/primes
g++ primes.cpp -o primes
./primes
```

## pernicious
### Description:
In number theory, a pernicious number is a positive integer that has a prime number of 1s in their binary representation. We are interested in numbers that are both prime and pernicious. For instance 7=1112
 is both prime and pernicious, 6=1102
 is pernicious but not prime, and 23=101112
 is prime but not pernicious.

This C++ program prints the value of all numbers between a and b that are both pernicious and prime, where a and b are positive integers supplied as input.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/pernicious
g++ pernicious.cpp -o pernicious
./pernicious
```

## reverse
### Description:
Given an integer by user input, this program computes its reverse (the number with the digits by the reverse order) and prints it.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/reverse
g++ reverse.cpp -o reverse
./reverse
```

## adigits
### Description:
Given three integers by user input, each one with a single decimal digit, the program returns the highest integer number that can be assembled with the 3 digits given as parameters.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/adigits
g++ adigits.cpp -o adigits
./adigits
```

## advance
### Description:
This program updates a date, which is implicitly defined in the format day/month/year (d/m/y), by adding a specified number of delta days.On exit, d, m, and y represent an elapse of delta days over the original date (taking into account leap years).
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/advance
g++ advance.cpp -o advance
./advance
```

## equation
### Description:
This C++ program solves the quadratic equation for the case where a, b, c are integer coefficients, with a≠0. The program returns the number of solutions for the equation (0, 1, or 2) and, in the case there are solutions, assigns the corresponding values to x1 and x2.

## nm
### Description:
A Mersenne number is a number of the form Mn=2^n−1 for some positive integer n≥0.

Given a number n by user input, this C++ program returns the lowest Mersenne number greater or equal to n.
