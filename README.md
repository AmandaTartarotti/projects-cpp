# projects cpp
The programs presented in this repository are simple projects and tests written in C++. 
Some of these programs are utilities and scripts that can be used on a day-to-day basis to perform certain functions.
The programs contained here were developed thinking about the Linux platform.

# Projects:

## calculate
### Description:
This program reads an integer value x and writes the value of x and x^2−x+1.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/calculate
g++ calculate.cpp -o calculate
./calculate
```

## even-odd
### Description:
That program reads an integer value x and indicates if x is even or odd (i.e., divisible by 2 or not).
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/even-odd
g++ even-odd.cpp -o even-odd
./even-odd
```

## range
### Description:
This is a program that reads two integers a and b and prints all numbers between a and b.
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/range
g++ range.cpp -o range
./range
```

## divisors
### Description:
That program reads an integer n and prints all numbers d between 1 and n−1 such that d is a divisor of n (e.g. 1, 2, and 5 if n is 10).
### Download:
Use git to clone the repository and use the g++ compiler to build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmandaTartarotti/projects-cpp.git
cd projects-cpp/divisors
g++ divisors.cpp -o divisors
./divisors
```
